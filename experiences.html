                <li>At Panera Bread, I proudly served as a dedicated and enthusiastic Team Member, contributing to the overall success of the restaurant through a range of responsibilities and customer-focused initiatives.</li>
                <li>Working at Panera Bread allowed me to develop valuable skills in customer service, teamwork, food preparation, problem-solving, and time management. It also showed me how much the company cares for its community as we would do daily food donations to local food banks. These experiences have enriched my professional growth and prepared me to excel in any customer-oriented role. I am excited to leverage these skills in contributing to the success of my future endeavors.</li>
